# Create-resources-in-Azure-Cosmos-DB-for-NoSQL-using-.NET
This Project, I create an Azure Cosmos DB account and build a .NET console application that uses the Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB SDK to create a database, container, and sample item. I learnt how to configure authentication, perform database operations programmatically, and verify my results in the Azure portal.
